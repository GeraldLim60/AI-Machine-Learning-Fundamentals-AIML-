    "## Overview of regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization in regression models aims to prevent overfitting by structurally imposing penalties on the model's coefficients.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. This is usually due to the model learning the noise in the training data, making it too complex and less generalized for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques, such as Ridge Regression, add an additional 'penalty' term to the loss function. The loss function is a measure of how well the model predicts the actual values. In simple terms, it measures the error between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, this penalty term is added to the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), which is the sum of the squares of the difference between the predicted and actual values. This additional term penalizes the model for having large coefficients, thus preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of minimizing the loss function thus becomes a trade-off between two factors: reducing the error between the predicted and actual values, and keeping the coefficients as small as possible. This balance helps to create a model that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review: Least Squares Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary least squares regression, a commonly used technique for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model, operates by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS). RSS is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model. In essence, it represents the differences between the actual output and the predicted output of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for RSS is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $y_i$ represents the actual output, and $\\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted output. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals, hence the term 'least squares'. Each predicted output $\\hat{y}_i$ is computed as the sum of the $\\beta_0$ intercept and the products of $\\beta_i$ with $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important points to remember here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning often comes down to optimization, which is the process of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions.\n",
    "- Training or fitting a model means minimizing a \"loss function\" (also known as a cost or objective function). For linear regression, this loss function is the RSS (or mean squared error, MSE), and the optimization is performed with respect to the $\\beta$ coefficients.\n",
    "- Minimizing the loss function results in the best set of $\\beta$ values for your regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can express the RSS in matrix notation using the predictor matrix $X$, the residual errors $\\epsilon$, and the vector of beta coefficients $\\beta$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS = \\varepsilon^T \\varepsilon = (X \\beta - y)^T (X \\beta - y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation provides the same information as the RSS formula, but in a more compact form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effect of Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the effect of regularization, let's consider a dataset on wine quality. A unique characteristic of this dataset that necessitates the use of regularization is the presence of **multicollinearity**, a term that refers to high correlations between predictor variables in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity can lead to several problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The estimated effect of predictor variables by your regression will be contingent on what other variables are included in your model.\n",
    "2. The effects of predictors can vary drastically depending on the observations in your sample, and small changes in samples can result in significantly different estimated effects.\n",
    "3. In cases of severe multicollinearity, the inverse matrix computed by the computer may not be precise.\n",
    "4. The interpretation of a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one-unit increase in that variable, keeping the other variables constant, is no longer valid. This is because when predictors are strongly correlated, there can't be a scenario where one variable changes without a corresponding change in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a scenario where you want to predict home prices using predictors like the number of bedrooms upstairs, the number of bedrooms downstairs, and the total number of bedrooms. This could lead to a high degree of multicollinearity, causing complications in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is particularly well-suited to handle multicollinearity. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, Ridge Regression discourages large coefficients, thereby reducing the risks associated with multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the Wine Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will be loading a comprehensive wine dataset that combines information about both red and white wines. The wines are distinguished by a binary indicator, where '1' represents red wine and '0' represents white wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes a variety of variables that are believed to be related to the rated quality of the wine. These variables can range from objective measures such as acidity levels, sugar content, and alcohol percentage, to more subjective measures like taste and aroma. By analyzing these variables, we aim to understand the factors that contribute to a wine's quality and how they interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this process is to load the dataset from a CSV file. CSV, which stands for Comma Separated Values, is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Columns in the CSV file are separated by a comma, and each row represents a unique wine sample with measurements for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the CSV file is loaded, we will have access to a structured dataset that we can manipulate and analyze using various machine learning techniques such as Ridge Regression."

    "In Ridge Regression, it is necessary to standardize the predictor columns before constructing the models, including dummy-coded categorical variables. The standardization process involves scaling the variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This allows variables of different scales to contribute equally to the model, ensuring that the model is not unduly influenced by variables with larger scales.\n",

    "### $$ \\text{Ridge penalty}\\; = \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the Ridge penalty is equal to the tuning parameter alpha times the sum of the squared beta coefficients. This penalty term discourages large coefficients by adding a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. As a result, the model is less likely to overfit to the training data. The value of alpha determines how much weight is given to the penalty term versus the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are the $\\beta$ coefficients affected by the mean and variance of your variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude and sign of the $\\beta$ coefficients are influenced by the mean and variance of the variables. If variables have a large variance, small changes can result in large changes in the predicted response, leading to larger $\\beta$ coefficients. Conversely, if a variable's variance is small, larger changes are required to affect the predicted response, resulting in smaller $\\beta$ coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the mean of the variables shifts the regression line along the axis of the predictor variable. This shift can change the $\\beta$ coefficients because changing the mean of a variable changes the position of the regression line, which in turn changes the slope of the line, and hence the $\\beta$ coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to standardize the predictors so that they are on a common scale, allowing for a fair comparison between the different predictors. Without standardization, a predictor with a larger scale will have a smaller coefficient than a predictor with a smaller scale, regardless of the strength of their relationships with the target variable."

In this model, we'll not only consider the impact of each predictor on the target variable but also how the predictors interact with each other and how these interactions affect the target variable. This approach results in a model that captures complex relationships within the data. However, it can also lead to overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "Ridge regression introduces a new component into the loss function: the Ridge penalty term. The equation for this is:\n",

    "### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS+Ridge = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 + \\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) represents the sum of the squared residuals, a measure of the model's error. However, Ridge regression adds a penalty to this loss function, which is designed to discourage large coefficients. This penalty term is the second part of the equation: $\\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of the equation are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\beta_j^2$ is the squared coefficient for each predictor variable $x_j$ in the model. Squaring the coefficient magnifies the effect of large coefficients, making them contribute more heavily to the penalty. This is what encourages smaller coefficients.\n",
    "- $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2$ is the sum of these squared coefficients for every predictor variable in the model. Note that this does **not** include the intercept $\\beta_0$. This sum forms the basis of the Ridge penalty term.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the tuning parameter, or regularization parameter, that determines the strength of the Ridge penalty. The larger the value of $\\alpha$, the greater the impact of the Ridge penalty on the loss function and the smaller the coefficients will be. Conversely, if $\\alpha$ equals zero, the Ridge penalty has no effect, and the model reverts to ordinary least squares regression. If $\\alpha$ is very large, the Ridge penalty dominates the loss function, which can lead to a model with very small coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing the Ridge penalty, Ridge regression can reduce the variance of the model and improve its performance, particularly in situations where the predictor variables are highly correlated. This comes at the cost of introducing some bias into the model, as the penalty term may cause it to underestimate the true coefficients. However, in many cases, this trade-off results in a net improvement in the model's predictive performance."
