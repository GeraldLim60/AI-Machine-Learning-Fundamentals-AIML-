    "## Defining and Visualizing the Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we're going to look at the Lasso Regression, which is a different approach from the Ridge Regression we've looked at previously. With Lasso Regression, we will see a difference in how the coefficients change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, much like Ridge Regression, is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where the data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean. However, the key difference in Lasso Regression is the way it penalizes the coefficients of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the loss function is altered by adding the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficient as a penalty term to the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). The formula for this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\text{minimize:}\\; RSS + Lasso = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta_j x_j\\right)\\right)^2 + \\alpha\\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $|\\beta_j|$ represents the absolute value of the $\\beta$ coefficient for the variable $x_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, $\\alpha$ is a parameter we need to choose that decides the strength of the penalty term. As with Ridge Regression, increasing the value of α will shrink the coefficients more, potentially setting some coefficients to zero if α is large enough. This is a form of feature selection, where the model selects which features to include by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero."

    "The adjusted R-squared for the Lasso Regression is approximately 0.20, while the adjusted R-squared for the Lasso Regression for the overfit data is approximately 0.17. These values represent the proportion of the total variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared statistic provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model. However, there is one drawback to the R-squared statistic: it will either stay the same or increase with the addition of more variables, even if those variables are only weakly associated with the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where adjusted R-squared comes in. The adjusted R-squared compensates for the addition of variables and only increases if the new variable improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the lower adjusted R-squared for the overfit data suggests that some of the additional predictors in the model do not significantly improve its performance, and may in fact be detracting from the quality of the model."
